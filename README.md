## **Project Overview: ChainReceipt**

This is a **blockchain-based billing and receipt tracking system** called "ChainReceipt" that provides a decentralized, tamper-proof way to manage customer purchases and receipts. The project combines traditional web APIs with blockchain technology for immutable record-keeping.

## **What it does:**

1. **Creates Digital Receipts**: Stores purchase records (items, prices, store info, timestamps) that cannot be tampered with
2. **Blockchain Integration**: Uses both Solana and Ethereum/Ink! smart contracts for storing receipt data
3. **REST API**: Provides HTTP endpoints for creating and retrieving receipts
4. **Immutable Records**: Once a receipt is stored on the blockchain, it cannot be modified, ensuring authenticity

## **Tech Stack:**

- **Backend**: Rust with Actix-Web framework
- **Blockchain**: Dual support for:
  - **Solana** (fast, low-cost transactions)
  - **Ethereum/Ink!** (smart contracts in Rust)
- **Serialization**: Borsh for blockchain data, Serde for JSON APIs
- **Data Models**: Receipt and Item structs with blockchain-compatible serialization

## **How to Use It:**

### **1. Run the Server:**

Navigate to the project's root directory and run:

```bash
cargo run
```

This starts a web server, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

### **2. API Endpoints:**

**Create a Receipt (POST):**

Endpoint: `POST /receipt`

- Creates a new receipt and stores it on the blockchain.
- Expects JSON data in the request body.
- Returns the created receipt data as JSON.

**Bash `curl` example:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/receipt \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
        "items": [
                {
                        "name": "Laptop",
                        "price": 1200.00,
                        "quantity": 1
                },
                {
                        "name": "Mouse",
                        "price": 25.00,
                        "quantity": 1
                }
        ],
        "store_id": "STORE123"
}'
```

**CMD `curl` example:**

```cmd
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/receipt ^
-H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
-d "{ \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"Laptop\", \"price\": 1200.00, \"quantity\": 1 }, { \"name\": \"Mouse\", \"price\": 25.00, \"quantity\": 1 } ], \"store_id\": \"STORE123\" }"
```

**Get a Receipt (GET):**

Endpoint: `GET /receipt/{id}`

- Retrieves a receipt by its ID.
- Returns sample receipt data if found, or an error if not.

**Bash `curl` example (replace `your_receipt_id`):**

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/receipt/your_receipt_id
```

**CMD `curl` example (replace `your_receipt_id`):**

```cmd
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/receipt/your_receipt_id
```

### **3. Data Structure:**

Each receipt contains:

```rust
{
        "id": "unique_receipt_id", // Generated by the system
        "items": [
                {
                        "name": "Product Name",
                        "price": 29.99,
                        "quantity": 1
                }
        ],
        "total": 29.99, // Calculated by the system
        "store_id": "store_identifier", 
        "timestamp": 1672531200 // Generated by the system
}
```

When creating a receipt, you typically only need to provide `items` and `store_id`. The `id`, `total`, and `timestamp` are usually generated by the server.

## **Use Cases:**

- **Retail Stores**: Digital receipt generation
- **Customer Tracking**: Purchase history management
- **Fraud Prevention**: Immutable proof of purchase
- **Returns/Warranties**: Tamper-proof purchase verification
- **Loyalty Programs**: Transparent reward tracking

The project is currently in development with basic API functionality implemented and blockchain integration partially complete. The dual blockchain approach (Solana + Ethereum) provides flexibility for different use cases and cost considerations.
