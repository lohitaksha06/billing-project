# ChainReceipt - Blockchain-Based Customer Billing & Purchase Tracking System

*A decentralized, tamper-proof system for tracking purchases and managing receipts.*

---

## 🚀 Overview

**ChainReceipt** is a blockchain-powered billing system that allows customers to securely track purchases, verify receipts, and manage loyalty rewards across retail stores. Built with **Rust** for high-performance backend operations and smart contracts, this project ensures transparency, reduces fraud, and simplifies returns/warranties for users.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Immutable Receipts**: Purchase records (item, price, store, timestamp) stored on-chain.
- **Customer Dashboard**: View and filter purchase history by store, date, or category.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Smart contracts handle refunds/overcharges with tamper-proof evidence.
- **Loyalty Rewards**: Automated points system with transparent redemption rules.
- **Privacy Controls**: Optional Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for anonymous analytics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Blockchain Layer

- **Solana** (for fast transactions) or **Ethereum** (with Ink! smart contracts in Rust).
- **Smart Contracts**: Rust-based (Solana’s Anchor or Ethereum’s Ink!).
- **IPFS**: Secure receipt storage (if needed).

### Backend (Rust)

- **Framework**: Actix-Web or Axum.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (user data) + Redis (caching).
- **APIs**: REST/GraphQL for frontend integration.

### Frontend (Optional)

- **Mobile**: Flutter/React Native (QR receipt scanning).
- **Web**: Next.js/React (dashboard for analytics).

### DevOps

- **Docker + Kubernetes**: Scalable deployment.
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Performance monitoring.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions.
